# querying Chinook Database

In this project, we'll query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 

## we'll be answering the following questions:

> - which artist has earned the most according to the
InvoiceLine? </br>
> - who are the artists with the most amount of albums created?</br>
> - what is the most sold genre? </br>
> - what is the most popular genre per country? </br>

## steps:
1- open the "chinook.db" via SQLite DB browser </br>
2- use the queries provided in "queries.txt" </br>
3- download the data extracted from the DB as a ".csv" file </br>
4- visualizing the extracted data using Microsoft Excel, you can view my visualiztions via "sql-project-submission-template-1.pdf"</br>


### the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
